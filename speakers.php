              <li>Apichart Vanavichit has a M.Sc. in plant breeding and a Ph.D. in crop science.  He was the lead Thai scientist in the team that sequenced the rice genome (IRGSP) with 9 other nations, and furthermore he established the Rice Gene Discovery and Rice Science Center to facilitate rice molecular breeding in Thailand.  His centers have led in the discovery of genes for 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (aromatic gene), Sub1C (flash flooding tolerance), Fe-toxic tolerance, waxy, and terpene synthase (brown planthopper resistance). Significant outcomes from his centers have established a high-through-put platform for breeding-by-pyramiding MAS to improve Thai Jasmine and low GI rice to withstand flash flooding, drought, heat, salinity, diseases and insects problems.  He has pioneered a new research frontier in rice; by using fast neutron bombardment to understand how genetic variation can be induced leading to the discovery of undiscovered or novel gene functions. He is also a leader in the molecular breeding of environmentally friendly rice. His high nutrition rice which has enriched grain iron levels, a high level of antioxidants and a low glycemic index has become a new national product.</li>

                      <li>Dr. Shetty's research interests focus on the critical role of cellular and metabolic basis of oxygen biology for advancing new innovations in life sciences and especially agricultural and food innovations that advance global food security and health in a sustainable environment. This focus is contributing to very innovative advances in the areas of crops for health, post-harvest biology, nutraceuticals, functional foods and food antimicrobial strategies as critical innovations to advance food security in addition to malnutrition and hunger challenges. In particular, he has developed an innovative “crops for health” research platform to counter diet-linked chronic diseases. The rationale of this platform has relevance for managing malnutrition challenges from maternal to child health needs globally.
      Dr. Shetty’s current passion and commitment are to develop “sustainable and ecological basis for healthy food systems, food choices and global food security” based on local crop and food diversity, traditional food systems and effective food imports that incorporates understanding of comparative cellular biochemistry of plant and animal systems and their interactions with prokaryotes (bacterial systems). This approach has potential to transform global agriculture with healthy food systems and innovative rural development strategies that is systems based with sustainable long term solutions combined with better habitat and environment, sanitation and diversified bioenergy options.
      In keeping with the above focus on new innovations to advance global food security on a “crops for health and sustainability” platform, Dr. Shetty is developing close collaborations between North Dakota State University and institutions in several regions of the world from Asia, Africa, and Europe to the Americas.

            <li>Brief Current Research: Development of processes with thermotolerant yeasts for bioethanol production. In this research we have used the effective thermotolerant ethanol fermenting yeast namely Kluyveromyces marxianus DMKU3-1042, which was isolated in Thailand. We have succeeded in development of ethanol fermentation process without temperature control and under non-sterile system at pilot scale by using sugarcane juice as a feed stock. We have plan to develop the strain and process for ethanol from lingo-cellulosic biomass.
                Development of the production of lipid to be used as feedstocks for biodiesel production. This is due to the fact that one of the most prominent renewable energy resources is biodiesel, which is produced from various sources of lipids including oleaginous yeasts. Economic improvement of microbial lipid production could be performed by finding low-cost raw materials together with oleaginous yeast strains that can use these raw materials for lipid production. We isolated Rhodosporidiobolus fluvialis DMKU-RK253 and R. fluvialis DMKU-SP314 and found that they are effective oleaginous yeast strains, which accumulate a large quantity of lipid when cultivated in glycerol and lingo-cellulosic sugars, respectively. We are developing the cultivation processes to get high lipid.  
                Diversity of yeast in natural habitats in Thailand. We have long experience working with yeast diversity study by both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches together with molecular taxonomy and phylogenetic analysis. We have proposed more than 50 yeast species from Thai strains. At present, we are focusing with the diversity of yeast in certain habitats viz. plant leaves, marine organisms and the flowers and fruits of palms, concerning which there are only a few reports in Thailand.
